Practice Questions

1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
(True and False. The values lack any quotes around it and the first letter always in capital letter and 
the rest of it is followed in lower case letters )

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
(and, or, not)

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator 
( Note: that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
AND:
True and True = True
False and True = False
True and False= False
False and False = False
OR:
True or True = True
False or True = True
True or False = True
False or False = False
NOT:
not True = False
not False = True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) (False)
not (5 > 4) (False)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) (True)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) (False)
(True and True) and (True == False) (False)
(not False) or (not True) (True)

5. What are the six comparison operators?
(==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
(== asks whether two values are same as each other. = Assigns the value into the variable)

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
(Conditions are flow control statements which decides what to do if the condition is true or false respectively.
Conditonal statements are useful when only a specific block of to be executed and avoiding unnecessary execution of other statements.)

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10: 
    print('eggs') (Block 1)
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon') (Block 2)
    else:
        print('ham') (Block 3)
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! 
if anything else is stored in spam.
spam = 1
if spam == 1:
    print('Hello!')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy!')
else:
    print('Greetings!')


10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
